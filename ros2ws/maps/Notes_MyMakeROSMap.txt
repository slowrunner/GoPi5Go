Major issue I have with the program is not allowing for setting the origin - I want the origin to be my robot's dock so have to manually edit the origin in yaml file with -x,-y of dock.  

Another issue is cannot click at the outside edge or even very close to edges of displayed floorplan if there is no white space around the plan.
