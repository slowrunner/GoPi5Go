It was going well on the global path planned, but apparently the local planner decided Dave was too close to a "pop-up" chair leg.  
Perhaps in this case an increased inflation value might work, but would cause more problem than it solves in other areas.  

### GoPi5Go-Dave Cannot Accurately Return To His Dock

## Seven Years Invested In GoPiGo3 Robots  
I am done.  Can't do it anymore.  
- The odometry is just not accurate enough.  
- The PID control does not drive straight.  
- Turns are not accurate.  
- The tires are not "grippy".  
- The encoder API is whole degree resolution.  
- The wheelbase is too narrow.
- The vendor stopped maintaining drivers two years ago.
- Vendor has no ROS 2 support  
- No other ROS 2 GoPiGo3 robots to learn from.
